 * DataQueue works incorrectly! We have global queue, so if a process
   is busy and does not receive network data, other processes may
   be blocked! This is not consistent with reality... MUST be fixed
   imediately
 * Data to self imlementation will spoil DATAQ WAIT stats -- no
   stats_start is called when network is passed over! Neet to add
   stats_start
 * To speed-up simulation, we may create a token with one data queue
   for each net segment in place 'data with route', if multiple data
   packages are send in one moment, simulator will not choke on large
   cartesian product in transition 'net'
