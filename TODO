 * Add to README.md description of preferred RBSim usage scenario describing
   usage of RBSim::Experiment. Good usage example can be found in
   nauka/mrzasa_dynosize/
 * Maybe it would be useful to add optional `:preemption` parameter to `cpu`
   statement in process model to enable user to define preemption levels.
   Currently, it can be done with the following piece of code:

             10.times do # can be preempted 10 times
               cpu do |cpu|
                 cpu_time / 10 / cpu.performance
               end
             end

   Obviously, it slows down simulation, but sometimes may be required.
   The preemption parameter could itself do the above.

 * Data to self imlementation will spoil DATAQ WAIT stats -- no
   stats_start is called when network is passed over! Neet to add
   stats_start
 * To speed-up simulation, we may create a token with one data queue
   for each net segment in place 'data with route', if multiple data
   packages are send in one moment, simulator will not choke on large
   cartesian product in transition 'net'
