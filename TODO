 * Data to self imlementation will spoil DATAQ WAIT stats -- no
   stats_start is called when network is passed over! Neet to add
   stats_start
 * To speed-up simulation, we may create a token with one data queue
   for each net segment in place 'data with route', if multiple data
   packages are send in one moment, simulator will not choke on large
   cartesian product in transition 'net'
